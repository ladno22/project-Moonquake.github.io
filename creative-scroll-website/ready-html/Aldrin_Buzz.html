                                    On September 9, 2002, conspiracy theorist Bart Sibrel tried to get 72-year-old Buzz Aldrin to swear on the Bible that he actually landed on the moon o
                                    n July 20, 1969. After refusing to take the oath, Sibrel directly accused 72-year-old Aldrin of never having been to the Moon and called him a “coward and a liar” (video of the incident). 
                                    he veteran responded with a hook to the jaw. Beverly Hills police and prosecutors dismissed charges against Aldrin, finding he was provoked.           </p>
